There are four main subdirectories:

1. [code](code/): with data analysis scripts and function definitions;
2. [figures](figures/): with code to generate the figures;
3. [manuscript](manuscript/): with files needed to compile the manuscript;
4. [tables](tables/): with code to generate the tables.

In the root directory there is also a [Makefile](Makefile) to document the dependencies among files.

Also, this project have its dependencies managed through [{renv}](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html).
